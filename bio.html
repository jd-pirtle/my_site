<h2>I love art.  I love design. I love math. I love science.</h2>
<h1>I love programming.</h1>
When I was younger, I played music and made art and read science fiction...sadly, all separately. Then, thanks to some good advice, I enrolled in a <a href="http://www.washington.edu/dxarts/index.php" target="_blank">BFA program</a> that fostered the intertwining of all of my interests.  Later, I found an <a href="http://adweb.aa.uic.edu/web/" target="_blank">MFA program</a> that encouraged me to take this notion even farther, in both my studio practice and as a graduate research assistant in a world-renowned advanced visualization lab.
<br><br>
Since then, I strive everyday to rise above roles and stereotypes about what we all should be when we grow up, and combine my passions into one professional practice.<br>
<br>
I currently am an artist and researcher at the Electronic Visualization Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  I spend my days at the lab programming: writing software for controlling large, multichannel audio installations, creating interactive multitouch applications, and driving interdisciplinary engagement and collaboration between computer artists and computer scientists.
<br><br>
I received my BFA with Distinction in Digital Arts in 2008 from the Center for Digital Arts and Experimental Media (DXARTS) at the University of Washington. While at DXARTS, I studied digital signal processing, real-time audio synthesis, algorithmic sound composition, sound spatialization, Ambisonics and psycho-acoustics with Juan Pampin and Joshua Parmenter from 2006-2008. From 2007-2008, I studied 3D modeling, animation, stereoscopic cinema, stereoscopic computer graphics, and computer motion with Stephanie Andrews. From 2007-2008, I studied digital media art theory and practice with Shawn Brixey and Richard Karpen.
<br><br>
I received an MFA in Electronic Visualization/New Media Arts from the School of Art and Design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I studied generative/software art, computer vision and physical computing with Daniel Sauter, Sabrina Raaf and Drew Browning.
